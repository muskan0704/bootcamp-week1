CEC Projects
This Repository contains two projects -
1. Image Rotation
This project accepts an Image and an angle by which the image is to be rotated and finally displays both the images.

System Requirements -
A basic C++ compiler is required (I've used MINGW).
For the first project, Opencv-C++ Library is also required.
